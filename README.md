# MNet_CDR_Seg

Code for TMI 2018 "Joint Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation Based on Multi-label Deep Network and Polar Transformation"

1. The code is based on: *Keras 2.0 + Tensorflow*
2. The input image is the disc center patch with *800 x 800* size.
3. The output is raw segmentation result without ellipse fitting.
4. The pre-train model *'Model_MNet_ORIGA_pretrain.h5'* is trained on *ORIGA full dataset*.
