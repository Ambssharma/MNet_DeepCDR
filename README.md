# MNet_CDR_Seg

Code for TMI 2018 "Joint Optic Disc and Cup Segmentation Based on Multi-label Deep Network and Polar Transformation"

Project homepageï¼šhttp://hzfu.github.io/proj_glaucoma_fundus.html

1. The code is based on: *Keras 2.0 + Tensorflow 1.0*
2. The output is raw segmentation result without ellipse fitting.
3. The code includes (A) Disc detection from whole image and (B) Disc/Cup segmentation from ROI region (size: 800x800). 
4. The pre-train models *'Model_DiscSeg_ORIGA_pretrain.h5'* and *'Model_MNet_ORIGA_pretrain.h5'*  are trained on **ORIGA full dataset**.
5. The cup-to-disc ratio (CDR) can be calculated by segmentation result (based on Matlab).
